/**
* Help Provider, a slightly more complex provider which populates the various Help buffers.
* A Live help will likely need to parse Help Files, and then on the state of the editor,
* dynamically build the help interface/contents for the user. In a live help buffer 
* for example the help provider will need to know the symbol of the current cursor position
* (i.e. a function currently adding paramaters to), and then display the help for that symbol.
